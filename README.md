Stupid jQuery Table Sort
========================

This is a stupid jQuery table sorting plugin. Nothing fancy, nothing really
impressive. Overall, stupidly simple.

[View the demo here](http://joequery.github.com/Stupid-Table-Plugin/)

See the example.html document to see how to implement it. All you really
need to do differently is make sure you're using ```<thead>``` and 
```<tbody>``` in case you don't normally use those elements.
