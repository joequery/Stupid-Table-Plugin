Stupid jQuery Table Sort
========================

This is a stupid jQuery table sorting plugin. Nothing fancy, nothing really
impressive. Overall, stupidly simple.

See the example.html document to see how to implement it. All you really
need to do differently is make sure you're using ```<thead>``` and 
```<tbody>``` in case you don't normally use those elements.
